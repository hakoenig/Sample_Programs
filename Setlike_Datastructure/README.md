# Implementation of a setlike data structure.

This code is for a setlike data structure that supports the operations Insert, Remove, and GetRandomElement.

The directory contains two files:

- SetlikeDataStructure.py
- TestSetlikeDataStructure.py

SetlikeDataStructure.py can be called via the command line with a list of elements as argument. It creates a setlike data structure with the input elements and also uses the Remove and GetRandomElement methods.
TestSetlikeDataStructure.py can be run via the command line as well and tests if the setlike data structure is working correctly.
